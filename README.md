# Regression-Modelling
This is a course project that aims to provide an analysis of the given used toyota cars dataset as well as predicting the price of used cars based on the year of manufacture, model name, odometer readings, and power type of the cars.
The project is originally coded in R as it is the main tool used in the course but for the purpose of personal portfolio, python is used in this documentation.
Analysis and model can be found in **'regression-modelling.ipynb'**.

Fully explained analysis can be found in [this article](bit.ly/RegressionModelling).
